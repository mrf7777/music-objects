# music-objects

A rust library that provides a comprehensive set of musical objects for western music.
These musical objects are sufficient to represent horizontal and vertical concepts in music: note pitches, chords, rhythm, tempo, metre, melody, etc.

## What this is not

This library does not contain advanced analysis tools, only primatives and basic functions for working with western music.
